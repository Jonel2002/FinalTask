Test Project
Implement a flight ticket scheduler using the Angular framework. For the application, the
following rules are to be applied:
▪ Create a Login page.
▪ Roles: Admin and User.
▪ User can see all tickets and filter them. (Please do not use a generic table for this feature or
even a table).
▪ Admin can have the same privileges as the user role with the addition of the ticket creation
feature.
▪ Admin can create more than one ticket in the same form without redirection.
▪ Ticket Fields: id, inbound, outbound, ticket_type, ticket_type_id (combination of the id and
ticket_type), price (changes in the same type of ticket, should be reflected), from_date, to_date,
or date_range, seat_number.
▪ Validate tickets to not allow duplication for same inbound, outbound, from, to, and seat_numer
values.
▪ Minimum tickets that the assignment will be valued as complete is 10,000.
▪ Implement a chart showing data based on some inputs (choose what you think is best and
makes more sense business wise).
Bonus
▪ Create a UML diagram for the architecture of your application.
▪ Document the application with any documentation tool of your choosing.
▪ Enable window communication so that the same action on one window would lead to the same
action on the other window. (E.g., open list of tickets on one window and on the other window
open ticket creation. The list of all tickets should be updated if a ticket is created without the
help of an endpoint call. )
To consider:
▪ Please use version control as much as possible, because repositories with only a single commit
will not be accepted.
▪ Use any UI library that is convenient.
